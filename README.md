# WhatDog
In this module, I created an app to identify dog breeds through a photo. This analysis was only possible through CoreML, where I created a model to make predictions based on new input data. With these predictions I collect information about the possible breed of the dog in the photo and present the data with a photo and description of the breed provided by WikiMedia through an HTTP request. 

I could learn:

- How to setting up a UIImagePicker.
- How use classifications from model.
- Make HTTP GET request to WIkipedia using Alamofire.
- Parse JSON results using SwiftyJSON.
- Import Imgae by URL with SDWbImage.
