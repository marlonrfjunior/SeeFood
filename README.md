# WhatDog
In this module, I created an application to identify dog breeds through a photo. This app gets information from WikiMedia with and characteristics of the dog the photo belongs to through Machine Learnin.

I could learn:

- How to setting up a UIImagePicker.
- How use classifications from model.
- Make HTTP GET request to WIkipedia using Alamofire.
- Parse JSON results using SwiftyJSON.
- Import Imgae by URL with SDWbImage.
